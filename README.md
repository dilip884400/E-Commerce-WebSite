#To run project on your local machine, you can follow these steps:


##Clone the Repository: Go to the GitHub repository page of the project you want to run. Look for the "Code" button and click on it. You'll find a URL that you can copy to clone the repository. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, and run the following command:

- bash
- Copy code
- git clone https://github.com/dilip884400/E-Commerce-WebSite.git


##Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project's directory using the terminal or command prompt. In many projects, you'll find a file called package.json that lists the project dependencies. To install these dependencies, run the following command:

- npm install

This assumes you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. If you don't, you'll need to install them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).



##Run the Application: 

- npm start
